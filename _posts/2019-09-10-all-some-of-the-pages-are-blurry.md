Unfortunately, sometimes files can get corrupted during download. When this happens, removing the issue and downloading it again will resolve the problem. Please see ["How do I archive or delete an issue from my device?"](/support-prototype/2019-09-10-how-do-i-archive-or-delete-an-issue-from-my-device)
